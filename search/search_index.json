Regular bug-fixing Update of documementation (split of widget documentation pages for Work Items and Plans Gantt) 1.5.0 - July 1, 2019 Big release with many customer enhancements and with addition of Plans Gantt Widget (added for free) justifies the big shift on version number. Support for duration fields in DurationTime format (converts to days only) Compare actual vs planned (requires Task Script to configure how to load the original schedule) Warning Due to major refactoring (as we were adding support for Plans data type), the widget needs to be reconfigured when you update from 1.0 to 1.5. This shall not happen in the future versions.

All the configuration options are described on Widget Parameters page. In this guide we dive deeper into configuration of Work Items Gantt Full Report Gantt The most common approach to show Work Items Gantt is to create a single LiveReport page, call it for example Gantt , and put the Work Items Gantt Widget as single widget there. In this case, we recommend to activate the following widget property: Advanced Maximize - set the Maximize property of the widget to 'yes' This will make the widget size equal to working area size. Please make sure there are no additional empty paragraphs or other whitespace content around the widget. Sometimes it is more useful to embed the Gantt widget to an existing report, together with other reporting widgets. In such case make sure that Maximize property is turned off. Warning Currently, it is possible to have only one Work Item Gantt widget on a page. Please do not add more of them on a single page. Data Mapping Once you have the widget on your page, you need to configure where to store scheduling information. The Gantt model is storing the following data: Start Date (Date) Duration (Number of days) Progress (Float from 0 .. 1) You can configure the mapping using the Advanced Widget parameters: Start Field - the name of the custom field, that stores the information when the work item starts. The type of the custom field can be any of these: Date, Date-Time or String. If such custom field does not exist, the value will be stored in String ad-hoc custom field. For production use, we recommend using a Date (Only) custom field. Duration Field - the name of the custom field, that stores the information about the work item duration as the number of days. The type of the custom field can be any of these: Integer or String. If such custom field does not exist, the value will be stored in String ad-hoc custom field. For production use, we recommend using an Integer custom field. Progress Field - the name of the custom field, that stores the progress of the work item progress as Float (multiply by 100 to get % of completion). The type of the custom field can be any of these: Float or String. If such custom field does not exist, the value will be stored in String ad-hoc custom field. For production use, we recommend using a Float custom field. Hierarchy The hierarchy of items on the Gantt chart is derived from work item links. This is controlled by Parent Role widget parameter: Parent Role - select what Work Item link roles should be used to detect the parent-child relationships. If empty, no hierarchy is shown. Dependencies The dependency links are also derived from the work item links. This is controlled by Dependency Role widget parameter: Dependency Role - select what Work Item link roles should be used to detect Depends-on relationships. If empty, no dependencies will be shown. If you select multiple link roles, the first role is used when creating new links. If you do not want to let the user create dependency links, put following property to Advanced Gantt Config Script parameter: gantt . config . drag_links = false ; Time Range By default the Gantt chart shows the time range as small as to fit the items. If you want to set the start and end date manually, for example to allow the dragging of the items to future, set following properties in Advanced Gantt Config Script (both need to be set). gantt . config . start_date = new Date ( 2018 , 12 , 10 ); gantt . config . end_date = new Date ( 2020 , 08 , 20 ); More There are more configuration options available, see Widget Parameters page for the full list. function initFreshChat() { window.fcWidget.init({ token: \"5bd41922-e50b-4faf-9a94-e51709c815d6\", host: \"https://wchat.freshchat.com\" }); } function initialize(i,t){var e;i.getElementById(t)?initFreshChat():((e=i.createElement(\"script\")).id=t,e.async=!0,e.src=\"https://wchat.freshchat.com/js/widget.js\",e.onload=initFreshChat,i.head.appendChild(e))}function initiateCall(){initialize(document,\"freshchat-js-sdk\")}window.addEventListener?window.addEventListener(\"load\",initiateCall,!1):window.attachEvent(\"load\",initiateCall,!1);","title":"Setup"},{"location":"setup/#setup","text":"","title":"Setup"},{"location":"setup/#installation","text":"Download the latest distribution from here Copy com.nextedy.polarion.gantt folder into [POLARION_INSTALL]/polarion/extension folder.
