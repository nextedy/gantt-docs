We have released a new version of Nextedy Gantt Widgets - the first interactive high-level project planning scheduling inside Polarion ALM. It is a major step forward that shows where we are heading with Nextedy Gantt Widgets - we aim to make planning in Polarion both robust and fun . Auto-scheduling Version 2.0 introduces the dependency auto-scheduling feature. Now items can be re-scheduled automatically based on dependency links between them. For example, imagine that you have two items connected by a dependency link and the second item starts when the first one ends, and you want to change the schedule of the first item by moving it to a new date. Auto scheduling updates the start date of the second item according to the end date of the first item each time when it changes (using Gantt view). This feature allows you to maintain the project schedule by specifying relations between items with no need to set dates of each task manually. This also means that auto-scheduling is triggered only when you change an item or modify a link. As a related feature - we have added a highlight if the start date of the dependent item is planned before the controlling item is being finished. You can configure if auto-scheduling should be turned on by default using a project level settings (see nextedy.gantt.default.auto_scheduling ) Critical Path To let you manage risks we added a critical project path visualization to your Gantt charts. A critical path is a sequence of items that may not be delayed. Otherwise, the whole project would be delayed. The critical path also determines the shortest time the project can take. An item is considered critical if it has no days of slack and any delay would directly affect the project completion date. Slack time is the time that an item can slip without affecting other items or the project's completion date. You can turn it on / off as needed directly from the toolbar. To configure if critical-path should be enabled by default use a project level settings (see nextedy.gantt.default.critical_path ) Undo/Redo The title says it all! Zoom In, Zoom Out It has been always possible to set the scale of the Gantt view. Now you can interactively zoom in and out for handy managing of time scale presentation. The possible scale options (set as widget property) have been extended as well to: DD - zoomed-in day scale, D - day scale, W - week scale, M - month scale, Q - quarter scale, Y - year scale and YY - zoom-out year scale. You can configure the width of time-line columns using a project level settings (see nextedy.gantt.zoom... ) Configuration Properties As you can see above, we have added tons of configuration options that you can define on Polarion project or Global level. Check this link to get the full list of configuration options. Available - Now! You can download the new version from downloads page . Same price - free update for existing customers.

Now you can configure the widget to use any combination of data Mapping: Start Field Duration Field , End Field Duration Field , or Start Field End Field . The property \"Start Field is End Date\" is now marked as deprecated, this means it still works well, we just recommend to switch to new format and just set the End Field mapping in Data Mapping section. We have moved all the data mapping settings into special category \"Data Mapping\". Release 1.8.0 Announcement 1.7.* - Sep 9, 2019 1.7.2 - Sep 30, 2019 Fix issue when removing dependency links. We support \"start_to_finish\" link types only so far, so create them by default. Inform user that just single gantt per page is supported. 1.7.1 - Sep 17, 2019 Support for working days, when Advanced Working Calendar == YES the item duration takes into account working days. The working calendar is defined by Global Polarion Administration Work Items Working Calendar 1.7 - Sep 9, 2019 New property Advanced Show Today Marker - if true, a today marker is added to the gantt. New property Advanced Start Field is End Date (calculate from end) - this one is tricky, if it is true, than the Start Field will be actually treated as end date. What? Simply read more at How to configure the gantt to compute the start date from end/due date? widgetContext object ( Class Javadoc ) has been added to Markers Script . It can be used to e.g. access the project context via widgetContext.getDisplayedScope().projectId() Progress coloring added - the gantt will now mark the tasks that end in the past and are unresolved as red, and those with planned progress date in a past as orange. If you do not like this behaviour, you can turn it off by adding gantt.config.show_progress_colors=false; into Advanced Gantt Config Script . We do not want to add a widget property to control this behaviour to restrict number of properties. 1.6.* - August 28, 2019 1.6.2 - August 28, 2019 Fix for ugly bug that custom field of type Date-Time was not supported for Start/End dates. We still recomend to use Date-only but some customers prefere Date-Time. 1.6.1 - August 27, 2019 Support for velocity scripting in Advanced Gantt Script parameter, see use case here: How to set the Gantt time range? 1.6.0 - August 23, 2019 Support for Markers Script, see How to add Markers via Marker Script? Regular bug-fixing Update of documementation (split of widget documentation pages for Work Items and Plans Gantt) 1.5.0 - July 1, 2019 Big release with many customer enhancements and with addition of Plans Gantt Widget (added for free) justifies the big shift on version number. Support for duration fields in DurationTime format (converts to days only) Compare actual vs planned (requires Task Script to configure how to load the original schedule) Warning Due to major refactoring (as we were adding support for Plans data type), the widget needs to be reconfigured when you update from 1.0 to 1.5. This shall not happen in the future versions. This was agreed upfront with paying customers. 1.0.* - May 29, 2019 1.0.3 - May 29, 2019 Action menu added Refresh action to reload the Gantt Drag children control - add an option to turn on/off drag children instantly on Gantt, the widget property holds the default Today Marker - add marker for today + scroll to today Set Scale - add an option to set the timeline scale instantly on Gantt, the widget property would hold the default. 1.0.2 - May 28, 2019 17:20 Documentation improvements Script support added to decorate a task based on work item properties, see Widget Task Script Infinite loop on parent links (should not happen in Polarion) does not cause gantt to fail (but data do not load).

Configure Gantt View There are two Live-Report widgets available Work Items Gantt - exposing Polarion Work Items as items on gantt Plan Gantt - exposing Polarion Plans as items on gantt Check following screenshot and \"Work Items Gantt\" in \"Work Items\" category. All the configuration options are described on Widget Parameters page. In this guide we dive deeper into configuration of Work Items Gantt Full Report Gantt The most common approach to show Work Items Gantt is to create a single LiveReport page, call it for example Gantt , and put the Work Items Gantt Widget as single widget there. In this case, we recommend to activate the following widget property: Advanced Maximize - set the Maximize property of the widget to 'yes' This will make the widget size equal to working area size. Please make sure there are no additional empty paragraphs or other whitespace content around the widget. Sometimes it is more useful to embed the Gantt widget to an existing report, together with other reporting widgets. In such case make sure that Maximize property is turned off. Warning Currently, it is possible to have only one Work Item Gantt widget on a page. Please do not add more of them on a single page. Data Mapping Once you have the widget on your page, you need to configure where to store scheduling information. The Gantt model is storing the following data: Start Date (Date) End Date (Date) Duration (Number of days) Progress (Float from 0 .. 1) You should select a combination of : Start Field Duration Field , End Field Duration Field , or Start Field End Field\" You can configure the mapping using the Data Mapping Widget parameters: Start Field - the name of the custom field, that stores the information when the work item starts. The type of the custom field can be any of these: Date, Date-Time or String. If such custom field does not exist, the value will be stored in String ad-hoc custom field. For production use, we recommend using a Date (Only) custom field. End Field - the name of the custom field, that stores the information when the work item ends. The type of the custom field can be any of these: Date, Date-Time or String. If such custom field does not exist, the value will be stored in String ad-hoc custom field. For production use, we recommend using a Date (Only) custom field. Duration Field - the name of the custom field, that stores the information about the work item duration as the number of days. The type of the custom field can be any of these: Integer or String. If such custom field does not exist, the value will be stored in String ad-hoc custom field. For production use, we recommend using an Integer custom field. Progress Field - the name of the custom field, that stores the progress of the work item progress as Float (multiply by 100 to get % of completion). The type of the custom field can be any of these: Float or String. If such custom field does not exist, the value will be stored in String ad-hoc custom field.

This is controlled by Parent Role widget parameter: Parent Role - select what Work Item link roles should be used to detect the parent-child relationships. If empty, no hierarchy is shown. Dependencies The dependency links are also derived from the work item links.
