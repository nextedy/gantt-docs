# Work Items Gantt 

*Work Items Gantt* brings the interactive high-level project planning & scheduling to Polarion ALM. 

It is extending the Polation Gantt , that is by default showing Polarion Plan items only, with capability to expose the standard Work Items (such as Features, Epics, Objectives, ...).
