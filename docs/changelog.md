### 1.5.0 <small>_ July 1, 2019 00:01</small>

* Big release with many customer enhancements and with addition of *Plans Gantt Widget* (added for free) justifies the big shift on version number.
* Support for duration fields in DurationTime format (converts to days only)
* Compare actual vs planned (requires Task Script to configure how to load the original schedule)

!!! warning
    Due to major refactoring (as we were adding support for Plans data type), the widget needs to be reconfigured when you update from 1.0 to 1.5. This shall not happen in the future versions. This was agreed upfront with paying customers.

* **Item Colors based on Type** - make it possible to color the tasks based on item type.
	* Partially possibly in 1.0.2 with `Task Script`

## Known Issues
